                    When I first started working as a bartender, it seemed like the perfect job. People, music, and late-night energy were all around me. I told myself that I enjoyed the chaos because it made me feel confident and enjoyable. Beneath the small talk and jokes, though, I was using my work as a means of avoiding my personal life. If I was always working, always pouring drinks, I didn't have to think about how anxious and disconnected I really felt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next day I phoned my doctor and told a close friend the truth. Speaking the words aloud scared me - yet it also brought relief. I began treatment for substance use plus for anxiety. With help from professionals and from friends, I chose to quit the bar job. The first months were hard. I had to learn again how to relax when no glass sat in my hand but also how to face stress without running away.
                </p>

                    The next day, I phoned my doctor and told a close friend the truth. Speaking the words out loud scared me - yet it also brought relief. I began treatment for substance use plus for anxiety. With help from professionals and from friends, I chose to quit the bar job. The first months were hard. I had to learn again how to relax when no drink sat in my hand, but also how to face stress without running away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I serve coffee in a small café, go to bed at the same time each night, and wake up with a clear memory of the night before. Some days remain hard - yet I now call a friend instead of uncorking a bottle. The day I left the bar, I didn't simply quit a job - I picked myself up for the first time in years. If your life appears lively to others but feels painful to you, I hope my story shows that you have permission to walk away and start anew.
