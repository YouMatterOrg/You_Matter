                    As I was brainstorming My Story (this series), I kept coming back to the Opening Story being one that I know very well. One that told how even in the darkest of nights, hope can grow out of the ashes. After some consideration, I determined that My Story would be the best way to open the series.

                    For the better part of my life I have battled against depression. I am now in my early 40s and have been at MHAEM for almost three years now. I feel that this is the first time that I am doing a real job. After so many years of working in IT without fulfillment and happiness, I finally have a clear sense of purpose through MHAEM. I was the sarcastic guy who said "If you love what you do, you'll never work a job again". Yesterday, I realised what they meant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two things have always been cornerstones of my existence: 1) a belief in the goodness of humanity and 2) that our ability to help one another is what defines us as human beings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last year, I had an experience that tested these core beliefs. I am still recovering from the damage that was done to them. I got caught up in a spiral of depression. I call them valley days because everything they touch turns into a heavy, dull, and hopeless feeling. The strength to go to work was hard for me to find, and I went to work angry, bitter, and feeling disconnected from my surroundings.While thinking about work in a negative way does not bring any positive things, it actually reminded me of my workplace when I had one of these valley days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the designated referral person and answering the incoming office calls, I received a call from a woman who was sobbing; not out of sadness but out of appreciation for the service she had received. She had recently been homeless, and our PATH team found her a warm place to stay. Her gratitude towards us for such a relatively simple thing was a reminder to me that even the smallest acts of kindness can have a huge impact on people's lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Very shortly after that call, I received a call from another client and she said how very important it was for her to have a Community Companion take her to the movies every week. The teams that I serve through ICMS and CSS have been indicated by those we serve as "life savers", and through observing our AOT programme, I have been able to see how it can assist clients in establishing stability. It is as if the universe has been sending me one reminder after another each day of all of the ways in which great deeds are accomplished at this organisation on a daily basis, albeit quietly. The many acts of compassion, both great and small, provided by my colleagues and mentors were the key elements in assisting me out of the deep depression I had fallen into. They provided assistance to their clients and also gave me assistance, even though they were completely unaware of it. Day after day, their kindness has continued to piece me back together and reintroduced me to the purpose for which I came to work in this field, which I lost in my struggles. Though I am still on my recovery journey and I am still working on becoming stable again, I no longer feel the bitterness and the rage that I once felt inside me. I can remember why I was driven to this work and what it means to me personally. To climb out of a valley is a long process, but with faith and the goodness of this organisation behind me, I am becoming stronger each and every day.
