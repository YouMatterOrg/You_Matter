                <p>
                    At 20 years old, Zak experienced a significant number of episodes with mental health. As a result of his symptoms, he began his journey to learn more about how he could help the organization known as "The Black Dog Institute", which began after he put on a charity event and raised funds for the organization on his birthday. Since he was young, Zak had always dealt with high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (and thought it was common), but the episode he suffered from was a total change for him, resulting in fear and confusion. He had no idea what was going to happen to him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In March 2019, Zak became aware of early symptoms of psychosis, and he became aware that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in December 2020. While the world was dealing with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the diagnosis of bipolar disorder came as a relief. Many people will be overwhelmed when they are given a diagnosis of a mental health disorder; however, Tucker felt relieved to have finally figured out what was wrong with him. He is grateful for the friends and family who supported him when they did not completely understand his illness, and he is thankful for all of the doctors who have pointed him in the direction of appropriate treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After becoming involved with therapy, Zak had his first manic episode, and, therefore, he was given medications for the first time. Currently, Zak is able to manage his mental health with therapy, medications, and active involvement in his wellness. He has a great desire to live a full and healthy life and has promised to do everything he can to continue living a stable and healthy life. Zak believes in treating mental wellness as he would with eating properly and exercising. He has always treated mental wellness as a vital part of life. He advises people to develop healthy routines that will enhance their mental well-being. This includes remembering to take medications, attending appointments, and maintaining daily routines. He believes that even if one is feeling healthy, it is important to maintain a connection with their support system and continue practicing healthy habits. Zak recently became a lived-experience presenter with the Black Dog Institute. Zak is eager to share his experience with as many people as possible. He believes that his story could help someone who feels alone or is struggling to understand their diagnosis. Zak has no shame about his mental illness. Instead, he feels proud of everything he has accomplished and is dedicated to using his experiences to help others. Zak wants everyone to see that a fulfilling life is possible. If he has to give one piece of advice, it is to keep in mind that no matter how dark it appears, the darkness will not remain forever. Mental health has good times and bad; over the years, one will learn to cope and understand their body's needs.
