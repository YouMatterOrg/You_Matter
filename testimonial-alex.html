                    I remember my freshman year of college like I remember a black-and-white film. Everything happened, but I wasn't really there. I woke up tired, went to classes but didn't absorb anything, ate because I had to, and went to bed. Weekends were the same. My friends were having these amazing college experiences and I was just... existing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At first, I thought it was just adjustment. Everyone talks about how hard college is, right? But by second semester, I realized something was really wrong. Getting out of bed felt like moving through quicksand. I'd shower and it would take all my energy. Small things that should be easy became impossible. I missed classes. I stopped answering texts. I lost interest in everything — things I used to love now felt pointless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The worst part was that I felt like I was wasting this opportunity. My parents were so excited about me getting into my dream school, and here I was, unable to enjoy any of it. I felt guilty for not being grateful, ashamed that I couldn't just "snap out of it," and terrified that something was fundamentally wrong with me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One day, my RA noticed I hadn't come out of my room in days and talked to me about going to the campus counseling center. I almost didn't go. I thought therapy was for people who were "really sick," and I was just... tired. But the counselor recognized depression immediately and helped me see that what I was experiencing was real, it was treatable, and it wasn't my fault.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Between therapy and medication, things started to shift slowly. The heaviness didn't disappear overnight, but gradually the world started to have color again. I could sit in class and actually listen. Food tasted good. I went to a friend's party and actually enjoyed it, not just tolerated it. I realized how much of my life I'd been missing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My junior year is nothing like my freshman year. Yes, I still have hard days, but the difference is that now I can feel present for the good ones. I can actually experience joy, not just read about it. If you're in college and struggling, please reach out to your campus health center. You don't have to get through this alone, and you deserve to actually enjoy this chapter of your life.
