                <p>
                    High school was supposed to be the best years of my life, or at least that's what everyone kept telling me. But for me, those years were consumed by constant worry. I'd wake up with my heart racing, palms sweating, convinced something bad was about to happen. In class, I couldn't concentrate because my mind was too busy running through worst-case scenarios.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I tried everything to hide it. I'd excuse myself to the bathroom to calm down. I'd avoid presentations and social situations. My grades started slipping because I couldn't focus, and my friends thought I was just being antisocial. Nobody knew that behind my quiet demeanor, my brain was working overtime, telling me I wasn't safe, that I would fail, that everyone was judging me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The breaking point came during junior year when I had a panic attack during an exam. I couldn't breathe, my vision got blurry, and I was absolutely convinced I was dying. I ran out of the classroom and spent the rest of the day in the nurse's office. That night, my parents took me to see a therapist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was in that therapist's office that I learned what anxiety actually is. Understanding that my brain's alarm system was just overactive — that it wasn't a character flaw or a sign of weakness — was transformative. I learned about how anxiety works, why my body was responding this way, and most importantly, I learned tools to manage it. I started doing breathing exercises, learned about cognitive distortions, and practiced exposure to the situations that scared me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It wasn't a quick fix, but it was real progress. Senior year was different. I still felt anxious sometimes, but now I understood what was happening and I had strategies. I gave a presentation in front of 50 people and my hands only shook a little. I applied to colleges even though the fear was there. I realized that anxiety doesn't mean I can't do things — it just means I have to be brave while doing them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, in college, I have good days and hard days. But I'm not controlled by my anxiety anymore. I'm the one in charge. If you're struggling with anxiety, please know that understanding your brain is the first step to taking back control. You're not broken. Your brain is just trying to protect you, and with the right tools, you can teach it that you're safe.
